# Sleipnir

Sleipnir, or Retro Mega Sleipnir, is a [Pegasus](https://pegasus-frontend.org) theme for handheld devices.

Adapted from [David Fumberger's RetroMega](https://github.com/djfumberger/retromega) theme. Completely rewritten from scratch by [plaidman](https://github.com/plaidman) as [Retro Mega Next](https://github.com/plaidman/retromega-next) to simplify code and allow to add new features easier. And now modified further by y-muller (RedSideOfTheMoon on Pegasus Discord).

The theme should look good on any device with a wide screen. The main target is the AYN Odin so the theme is named after Odin's eight-legged horse.

I tested it on a device with a 640x480 resolution and it still looked pretty good.

The newest release adds initial support for Retro Achievements. There might still be some rough edges.

## Installation and Scraping
[Download](https://github.com/y-muller/retromega-sleipnir) and extract to your [theme directory](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/user-guide/installing-themes) under the folder retromega-sleipnir. You can then select the theme in the settings menu of Pegasus.

The theme uses `boxart2dfront` on the games list, `screenshot`, `logo` and `boxFront` in the game detail view, and `video` in both areas.

To setup Pegasus with scraped assets, there's a great written guide [available here](https://basvroegop.nl/pegasus) or a great video guide [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGWve7YYwGQ). You can also use [DragoonDorise's pegasus installer](https://www.pegasus-installer.com/) to scrape files on your device easier.
